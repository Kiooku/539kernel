# Glossary

**Bootloader:** Code that is responsible for loading the main kernel from the disk to the main memory so the kernel can be executed.

**Register:** Small memory inside the processor’s chip. We can store and read data form it, the registers are too small and too fast.

**General purpose registers:** Can store any kind of data. The size of each one is **32 bits**.

**Special purpose registers:** Provided by the architecture for some specific purposes.

**Fat binary *(`FatELF`)*:** Binary format where the software machine code of ***multiple processor architectures are gathered in one binary file*** and the suitable machine code will be loaded on run based on the type of the system’s processor.

**Flat binary:** File which doesn't use any specification, instead, the output is stored as is with no additional information or organization, only the output machine language of our code.

**Object file:** Machine code of a source file, generated by the compiler. It’s not an executable file, and it can be linked with other object files to generate the final executable file.

# Other information

- `ESI`, `EDI`, `EBP` and `ESP` are considered as general purpose registers in x86 architecture *(according to Intel’s manual)*, they store some important data in some cases, and it’s better to use them carefully if we are forced to.
